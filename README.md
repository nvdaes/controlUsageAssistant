# Control Usage Assistant #

* Author: Joseph Lee, Noelia Ruiz Mart√≠nez


Use this add-on to find out how to interact with the focused control.
Press NVDA+H to obtain a short help message on interacting with the focused control, such as checkboxes, edit fields and so on.

Go to NVDA's menu, Preferences submenu, Settings dialog, Control Usage Asistant category to configure add-on settings:

* Automatic messages for focus: Checked by default.
* Type the message to be used when an object can be activated: You may include a short message indicating the default or your configured gesture to know if the current object has an associated action when pressing a gesture like NVDA+enter in object navigation.
* Select output modes for automatic messages: This list of checkboxes allows to select speech and braille.
* Pitch change for automatic messages: This spin box allows to set the pitch change when NVDA reads automatic messages (from -30 to +30).
