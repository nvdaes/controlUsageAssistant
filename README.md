# Control Usage Assistant #

* Author: Joseph Lee, Noelia Ruiz Mart√≠nez
* Download [stable version][1]
* NVDA compatibility: 2021.3 and later

Use this add-on to find out how to interact with the focused control.
Press NVDA+H to obtain a short help message on interacting with the focused control, such as checkboxes, edit fields and so on.

Go to NVDA's menu, Preferences submenu, Settings dialog, Control Usage Asistant category to configure add-on settings:

* Select output modes for automatic messages: This list of checkboxes allows to select speech and braille.
* Pitch change for automatic messages: This spin box allows to set the pitch change when NVDA reads automatic messages.

## Note

Be aware: automatic messages shouldn't be spoken in documents that support browse mode, but sometimes this cannot be avoided due to focus changes. To prevent this, you can disable these messages for specific applications using NVDA's configuration profiles.
